[Patently.ai](http://www.patently.ai/){:target="_blank"} aims to make the process of filing patents easier by making patent discovery painless. It utilizes machine learning and natural language processing tools to parse through all available US patents and provides similarity scores for a patent idea. I designed and developed the front-end of patently.ai's search engine.
