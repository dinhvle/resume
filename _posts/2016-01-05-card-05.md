This is the very first app I've created. I wanted to create a conversational interface that can be incorporated into any web page. The [bot](http://high-pitched-church.surge.sh){:target="_blank"} could answer simple questions or harder questions depend on how smart you make it. One possible implementation of the bot is to make the about page of any website more fun and interactive.
